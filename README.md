# Project Description
The goal of our project is to build a high-transparency, tamper-free, and secure platform for connecting employers and domestic helpers in Hong Kong, fostering trust between them. The platform utilizes blockchain technology, a well-designed database, and a user-friendly interface. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and key features.

# Features

  * Secure and Tamper-Proof Database: The project employs blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized modifications or deletions. A verification system is implemented to validate the authenticity of data before entering the blockchain.
  * Efficient Data Querying: Users can specify various query constraints to conveniently access relevant data. The user interface provides intuitive components to streamline the querying process and maximize convenience.
  * User-Friendly Web Interface: The web interface is designed to enhance the overall user experience. We have studied existing platforms and adapted their successful approaches to create a well-structured and intuitive interface for both helpers and employers.
  * Trust-Building Feedback System: The platform allows helpers and employers to provide feedback to each other, fostering a mutual understanding and trust. Personal information is not required, ensuring privacy while encouraging transparency and discouraging misbehavior.
